## Project Description

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. This React-based app will allow users to filter the employee list by first or last name as they type; in addition, users can sort the list by the employee location, first name, or last name for readability.

```

## Criteria

```md
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:
